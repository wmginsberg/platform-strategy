  <h1>How can I build a website?</h1>
  <p>
    People are always asking what the best way to get involved with coding is. The short (and long) answer is that there are about 1 bajillion ways to get started, so the advice I give is the advice I get from developer friends when I want to learn something new in development as well: pick a project and learn by building it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website">Static websites</a> are cool, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application">dynamic web apps</a> are even cooler. Both can be a daunting project to take on even if you have a bit of coding experience, when the former is actually a pretty simple thing to make!
  </p>
  <p>
      To help you get past staring at a blank <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime</a> file, the web development equivalent of staring at a blank Word (or Google) doc when writing a paper, I've written up this quiz. 

  </p>
  <p>
      <i> Note: I didn't build this web app myself, I stole it (with permission) from <a href="www.twitter.com/owencm">Owen</a>.</i> <br />
      <i> Other Note: This is my humble advice, it\'s certainly not Google's opinion or 100% (or even 50%) comprehensive. If you have suggestions/additions feel free to submit a PR on GitHub, or file your complaints as Issues!</i>

While users that would install your native app would be more engaged than web app users, for your use case it sounds like reaching approximately 3X more monthly users is more important than increasing repeat usage amongst your power users, and the lack of an install step on the web will enable that.

          You may want to consider building your web app as a Progressive Web App, allowing you to provide a more-app like experience. Progressive Web Apps are able to send Android and desktop users push notifications just like native apps and can prompt Android users to add it to their home screen, providing much of the high engagement benefit of an Android native app.

          It sounds like your product is one which benefits from reaching lots of users easily, rather than reaching a very small group and engaging them deeply. Given that, we'd normally recommend building a web app due to the low friction of the web (thanks to lack of install step), but unfortunately it sounds like there's some feature you need that web browsers on Android can't currently provide (it's worth double checking this since they often support a lot more than you may think).

          Native apps aren't generally a good match for more transactional products since the aquisition funnel with apps cuts out a huge number of potential customers, and as your use case doesn't benefit greatly from re-engaging existing users it won't be possible to make up for that loss of users with increased engagement from your app users.

          Given the above, we'd encourage you to rework the idea into something that makes sense to reach fewer users but engage them often (in which case an app may make sense), or reduce the core set of features to what is possible to be built on the web.

          You could also consider buildling an Android app at some point, which would give you Play Store presense and allow you to be more aggressive on your mobile site about encouraging people to install it, although the data indicates that Progressive Web Apps can provide the same app-like experiences for users that have added them to their home screen without large APK downloads, which is why we're recommend prioritizing that.

          For your iOS users you'll likely want to encourage visitors to your site to install your iOS app.

          You could consider also building an Android app although it will be important to weigh the additional cost of building for a third platforms against the additional value the native app could provide for your most passionate Android users over investing the same effort into improving your Progressive Web App which impacts all of your users.

          Since your product is optimized for highly engaged users it seems optimal to reach a smaller group of highly engaged users rather than a large group of less engaged users, hence building an app is a good fit.

          To support multiple platforms but keep down the costs we recommend you build a hybrid app. These generally provide a less polished user experience, but are a cheap way of bringing a product to market.

          Alternatively you could consider using React Native as a slightly more expensive way to share the majority of code between Android and iOS while providing an improved user experience compared to a hybrid app. Additionally, by building a React Native app you can take advantage of services like AppHub that allow you to update your apps on users phones without going through Apple review, which drastically increases the speed at which you can iterate on your product.

React Native apps use native UI controls and feel highly polished, unlike hybrid apps which are an even cheaper way of building apps that work across both Android and iOS, but at the expense of high quality UX.

            You may want to consider building the app with React Native. React Native allows you to write apps in a way that the core code can be re-used if you later choose to write an Android version.

        The most obvious choice would be to build iOS and Android apps, although you may want to consider the high friction associated with trying to get users to install your app (which results in high user aquisition costs in app install ads).

        A possible alternate approach is to build an iOS app and a Progressive Web App. Progressive Web Apps allow you build a high quality app-like experience that would allow users on any platform to try your service with none of the install-time friction associated with app installs.

        On Android you can then have your Progressive Web App act as a way to get a large number of users to try your product, and then prompt those users to add it to their home screen and to enable push notifications. That approach allows you to target your power users with an installed app-like experience, while providing a smoother aquisition funnel and allowing users that would simply don't want to install your app to engage more lightly.

Most likely those users will want to use an aggregator that aggregates your content or service with your competitors in a single app.

          Given that users will likely be reluctant to install your app, we recommend you build a web app. Web app users are on average less engaged, but that is made up for by the fact that that you will get far more of them since they don't have to make it over the 'install barrier' associated with apps.

To enable that group of passionate users to be highly engagaed it will be important to ensure those users are able to get your app on their home screen and receive push notifications.

          Since you don't have the resources to build for two platforms you have two main options: build a native iOS app, or build a Progressive Web App.

          If you build an iOS app you will be able to provide a great UX to the iOS users that overcome the friction associated with installing an app. Once they have the app they will likely be highly engaged.

          On the other hand, if you build a web app you will likely be able to reach 3X the number of monthly users ((<a href='http://www.slideshare.net/VictorKongCisneros/the-2015-us-mobile-app-report-by-comscore/17' target='_blank'>according to ComScore</a>) due to the lack of install friction, but those users will be less engaged since they do not have an icon on their home screen, or push notifications enabled. If you build a Progressive Web App (rather than a traditional mobile site) you will be able to provide a more app-like experience, and you will be able to prompt Android users to add your web app to their home screen and to enable push notifications. Additionally, with a web app users on all platforms will be able to use your product.

          The decision between building an iOS app or Progressive Web App really comes down to whether you'd prefer fewer users that are more engaged, or far more users that are on average less engaged, with only the most engaged users adding your web app to their home screen.

For example, it largely makes more sense for stores to sell their goods through the Amazon app rather than build their own app.

            If it makes sense for your business, you may want to look into providing your content via Accelerated Mobile Pages or Facebook's Instant Articles in order to get traffic from Google and Facebook.
