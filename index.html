Web app users are less engaged than native app users, but for your use case it sounds like reaching approximately 4X more monthly users is more important than increasing repeat usage amongst your power users, and the lack of an install step on the web will enable that.

          You may want to consider building your web app as a Progressive Web App, allowing you to provide a more-app like experience. Progressive Web Apps are able to send Android users push notifications just like native apps and can prompt users to add it to their home screen, providing much of the benefit of a native app.

          Native apps aren't generally a good match for more transactional products since the aquisition funnel with apps cuts out a huge number of potential customers, and as your use case doesn't benefit greatly from re-engaging existing users it won't be possible to make up for that loss of users with increased engagement from your app users.

          Given the above, we'd encourage you to rework the idea into something that makes sense to reach fewer users but engage them often (in which case an app may make sense), or reduce the core set of features to what is possible to be built on the web.

          You could also consider buildling an Android app at some point, which would give you Play Store presense and allow you to be more aggressive on your mobile site about encouraging people to install it, although the data indicates that Progressive Web Apps can provide the same app-like experiences for users that have added them to their home screen without large APK downloads, which is why we're recommend prioritizing that.

          For your iOS users you'll likely want to encourage visitors to your site to install your iOS app.

          You could consider also building an Android app although it will be important to weigh the additional cost of building for a third platforms against the additional value the native app could provide for your most passionate Android users over investing the same effort into improving your Progressive Web App which impacts all of your users.

          Data from ComScore indicates that the top 1000 mobile web sites reach 4X more monthly active users than the top 1000 apps, so we believe a Progressive Web App that encourages iOS users to install the iOS app, and Android users to add the Progressive Web App to their home screen is likely the best strategy.

          Since you expect to drive the majority of your engagement from a small number of highly engaged users, building an app is a good fit.

          To support multiple platforms but keep down the costs we recommend you build a hybrid app. These generally provide a less polished user experience, but are a cheap way of bringing a product to market.

          Alternatively you could consider using React Native as a slightly more expensive way to share the majority of code between Android and iOS while providing an improved user experience compared to a hybrid app. Additionally, by building a React Native app you can take advantage of services like AppHub that allow you to update your apps on users phones without going through Apple review, which drastically increases the speed at which you can iterate on your product.

React Native apps use native UI controls and feel highly polished, unlike hybrid apps which are an even cheaper way of building apps that work across both Android and iOS, but at the expense of high quality UX.

ComScore reasoninged that the top 1000 mobile web apps receive almost 4X more monthly users than the top 1000 mobile web sites, so the potential for traffic is large.
